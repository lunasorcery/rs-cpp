# rs-cpp

**rs-cpp** is a C++ header that attempts to bring Rust-like semantics to C++.

### How do I use it?

```cpp
#include <cstdio>
#include <rust.h>

fn main() -> i32 {
	let message = "Hello, World!";
	puts(message);
	return 0;
}
```

### Luna, please, at this rate you'll have more joke projects on GitHub than serious ones...

...so what?
